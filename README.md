# Visual Tabs

Create a custom new-tab page extension featuring your own content for Chrome, Firefox, or Brave.

To showcase what’s possible, we’ve created **Sapiare New Tab**, which features evocative visual thinking, a curated selection of paintings, and tweet-style quotes from some of the greatest thinkers and builders in history. 

It’s available in both the Chrome and Firefox extension stores.

Anyone with the extension installed will automatically receive any new content you publish. They would only need to update the extension if you add new functionality or new content templates. 

## Install Sapiare New Tab

- [Chromium based browsers](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sapiare-new-tabs/cbopbiocoldcmakpfnfddhmbgcaalepo).
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/es-ES/firefox/addon/sapiare-new-tab/)

## For developers

The content is stored in the `data.json` file, and images are stored in the `img` folder. To submit your extension to the browser stores, you only need to upload the **extension folder**. 

When uploading your extension to the Firefox Add-ons store as a ZIP file, make sure that `manifest.json` is located at the root of the archive. To do this, select all files and folders inside the **extension directory**, not the directory itself.

## How to add content
You can edit the file to add more content or run `deno task dev` to open a CMS
([Deno](https://deno.com/) is required).

Just two people having fun building something simple and beautiful. I handled the code, and [José Luis Antúnez](https://jlantunez.com/) handled the design and content.
